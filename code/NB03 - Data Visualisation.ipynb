    "Pop music slightly rises and falls from year to year but generally maintains a share of the chart between 25%-40% and doesn't show much significant change from 2000-2023. Rap and Hip Hop shows a sharp decrease from 2009 until 2020, which is interesting, and potentially could align with the theory that resession alters music consumption, althogh the causality is not clear. Similarly, EDM had a sharp increase in 2009 that it has maintained relatively constantly through 2023. Again, this follows the theory that the recession impacted consumption, increasing club/party music, which is typically theorized to be popular 'recession music'. This also shows that more 'minor' genres (rock, indie, R&B) were more popular until 2008, where they decreased in popularity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, although there is no causality reflected in this graph, it is interesting that there does seem to be a partial shift in 2008-2009 (potentially in line with the recession) where EDM rose in populraity, and Rap and other, less popular genres fell. "

    "Zooming in on the minor genres (not pop, edm, or rap) shows a general decline in their populariy since 2000. If music listening is related to economic conditios, it seems that the 2008 recession was correlated with a drop in popularity of minor genres, while the covid-19 (more minor recession) was correlated with a rise in popularity of minor genres. Its unclear why there would be different music consumption for the different recessions, but it does appear that those time periods are the turning point. It is also generally interesting to see that minor genres are decreasing in popularity as the charts are becoming more dominated by the same 3 genres. \n",

    "This analysis provides insights into the interplay between genre popularity in the UK Top 40 charts and economic conditions over the past two decades. Key conclusions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Dominance of Major Genres:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pop, EDM, and Rap consistently dominate the charts, with EDM emerging as the most frequent genre after 2009.\n",
    "- Minor genres (Rock, Indie, R&B, etc.) have seen a steady decline in popularity, suggesting a shift in listener preferences or industry trends toward mainstream sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Impact of Economic Conditions:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 2008 recession coincided with a significant rise in EDM's popularity and a decline in both Rap and minor genres, aligning with theories of recession music favoring pop, high-energy, and club sounds. Although causality can't be established from this data, it does support previous theories of recession pop and recession music generally. \n",
    "- During periods of economic stability, there is greater diversity in genre representation, although Pop and EDM remain dominant.\n",
    "- The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 saw a resurgence in Rap and a temporary increase in minor genre popularity, hinting at differing impacts of economic uncertainty based on its nature and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Trends in Minor Genres:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minor genres show a long-term decline, particularly after 2008, with their minimal representation during recessions. This trend may reflect a consolidation of music preferences around the most popular genres during challenging economic periods."
